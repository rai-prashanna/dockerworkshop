# dockerworkshop-2

#### Problem

Create a Dockerfile with following environment:

* Use the ubuntu linux image
* Setup nginx server
* Copy this folder named static-content from the cloned repo to the /usr/share/nginx/html
* Expose the port 9999 in the host and link with the default nginx port i.e 80
* Push your Dockerfile to the repo with new branch name.

When the container made from our custom image, static-content/index.html file should be accessible from the browser at 
localhost:9999/
or
http://localhost:9000/site/index.html
